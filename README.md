### Simple Diffusion Model from scratch

This is a simple diffusion model from scratch using PyTorch

Using the DDPM model and the original paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239

I made my own U-net (ish) model that resembles the actual architecture of the DDPM model.

Did not use time embeddings or anything fancy.
